## Conversation Summary

user: [Sun 2026-02-08 10:30 GMT+8] Hi

assistant: Hey. I just came online — looks like this is a fresh start for both of us.

I'm an AI assistant running in OpenClaw, but I don't have a name or much of an identity yet. My workspace is basically empty — no memories, no preferences, no history.

So: who are you? And what should I call myself?

If you want suggestions — I could be something like **Claw** (fitting, given the platform), or something totally different. Your call. 🦀
